### Troubleshooting
A problem I had occur to me when I was making this was my anti-virus, which was Malwarebytes premium, was flagging the file for a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program) game hack. Now if this is not obvious to you it is infact a game hack but I still thought to add this section incase you had any suspiscion regarding similar warnings, here is a screenshot. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8ce330d-16e4-4e50-ba11-07d6d75bec90) Please do not be alarmed by this and accuse me of making malware, it is a game hack so it probably will be flagged as it does stuff like altering and buffering game memory to function.

- If you have any other concerns regarding troubleshooting the client please make an issue, don't be hesitant, the sooner it works the better.
